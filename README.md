Download and install Lightstreamer Vivace (make sure you use Vivace edition, otherwise you will see a limit on the event rate; Vivace comes with a free non-expiring demo license for 20 connected users).
Go to the "adapters" folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation. Create a new folder and call it "3DWorldDemo". Create a "lib" folder inside it.
Copy the "ls-adapter-interface.jar" file from "Lightstreamer/lib" in the newly created "lib" folder.
Copy the "croftsoft-math.jar" file from "Lightstreamer/lib" in the newly created "lib" folder. <--- TODO no
